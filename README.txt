More information about my work with children:
    When I was in high school, I was the leader of our robotics team. Outside of the club, I would often provide support to the middle school robotics club to help them prepare for the FIRST LEGO League challenges. We coded primarily in Scratch and Pybricks, and focused on developing problem-solving skills and technological creativity. It was a whole lot of fun to watch the kids learn, make mistakes, and troubleshoot. 
    Also in high school, I worked two summers as a counselor at the Packer day camp for children ages 4-5, where I was trained to identify and handle behavioral issues, give swim lessons, and communicate with the kids individually and as a group. We also helped with fun activities such as science lessons and arts and crafts. 
    The summer before college, I taught film and technology over Zoom weekly as a volunteer for kids aged 7-12 (separated by age). This was when kids were unable to have in-person extracurricular activities because of COVID. We focused on filming and editing short movies with a phone, tablet, or computer. Other than that, I've spent a lot of time babysitting, my favorite part of which is helping with homework.
